    cd youtube-to-blogger-ai

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You'll need to create a requirements.txt file listing all Python dependencies like google-api-python-client, google-auth-oauthlib, transformers, torch/tensorflow, nltk, spacy, etc.)

Set up API Credentials:

YouTube Data API: Obtain API keys and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console.

Blogger API: Configure API access for Blogger in Google Cloud Console.

Speech-to-Text API: Configure API access for your chosen Speech-to-Text service (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text).

LLM API (if using commercial): Set up API keys for services like OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4) or integrate with local/hosted open-source LLMs.

Store your credentials securely (e.g., environment variables or a .env file).

Configure the project:

Update configuration files (e.g., config.py or settings.py) with your API keys, desired blog ID, and any specific content generation parameters.

Run the automation:

    python main.py --video_url "YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL"

    (Replace main.py with your actual main script name and YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL with the target video URL.)
